We got about 8500 pages first without doing the analysis.

Then we edited the code so that we can track the number of bad links and the subdomain.

We have changed the port to 9300 and ran the code. However, when we got 1811 pages, we got the "Attribute" problem. We tried a lot of times and also met the connection problem,

even the reset_frontier file can not work.



So we submitted 2 frontier_summary files, one is the 8500 without analysis, another one is the file with analysis.
